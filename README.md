### Corrections Made:

1. **Consistent Code Block**: I've wrapped the commands inside a single code block with three backticks (`` ```bash ``) and removed the extra ```bash that was incorrectly placed.

2. **Comments**: Added comments before the commands to provide context on what each command does.

3. **Punctuation and Grammar**: Ensured proper punctuation and grammar in the description.

Feel free to adjust the comments or commands according to your specific needs! If you have any more requests or need further assistance, just let me know.
